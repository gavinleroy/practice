THIS REPO IS FOR MY CODING PRACTICE FILES!! 
THERE IS NOTHING TO DOWNLOAD HERE.

When I do practice on a website such as Code Chef, Hacker Rank, Hacker Earth or problems from textbooks I will eventually push my finished code into this repo. This way I can I always keep it handy and show that I still do things even when I'm not working on a project.
